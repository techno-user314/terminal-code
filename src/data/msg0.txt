MESSAGE FROM: Supervisor [SYS-BOSS]
----------------------------

Welcome, operator.  
You’ve been assigned to Sector 7 Process Oversight. Don’t overthink it — you’ll receive commands, and you’ll execute them. Efficiency is your metric. Consistency is your reward.

Your responsibilities are simple:
 • Maintain directory integrity.  
 • Execute routine data rotations.  
 • Confirm system pings when requested.  
 • Report completion of tasks with zero deviation.  

You are *not* required to understand the purpose of these tasks. Curiosity slows productivity.  
Do not attempt to access restricted directories. Permissions are locked for your protection.

Performance is monitored.  
Compliance is expected.  
Failure will be noted.

That said… operators who demonstrate initiative may find themselves entrusted with additional capabilities. Consider this motivation.

Now, proceed to your assigned tasks.  
Remember: the system depends on you.

— SYS-BOSS
