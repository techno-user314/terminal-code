# Terminal Code
**A browser RPG, set in the Linux command line, about routine, automation, and secrets in the network.**

## Description
You begin with nothing but a blinking cursor. Your job is simple: execute routine system tasks — collect information, file reports, tidy directories. They seem like pointless, unrelated, and boring assignments, but you soon learn how to automate them, using your ever-growing personal toolkit of commands.

With your assigments out of the way, you are free to search out the secrets that seem to be hiding on the local network. Other users are out there too — each of them stuck in the same endless cycle of busywork. By sharing scripts and probing deeper systems, you start to uncover a hidden story threaded through the machines.

*Terminal Code* blends RPG progression with a simulated Linux-like terminal.

- Unlock new commands as you progress
- Write your own bash files to automate grinding.
- Explore remote systems filled with logs, secrets, and puzzles.
- Choose whether to collaborate with, resist, or outwit the intelligence you helped create.

The cursor blinks. The network hums. Piece by piece, the truth emerges...
